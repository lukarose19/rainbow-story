        The group scatters, panicked at the loss of their leader. The Farmer’s Son runs to you, babbling about how heroic you looked. You open your arms to hug him, but he is snatched away from you by one of the thieves. You watch in horror as the thief slits his throat. He falls to the ground. You take his body back to the farmer. He was so young.       </p>

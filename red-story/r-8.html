        You decide to check it out. It’s a crew of thieves! You realize how far away from town you are, as thieving crews don’t dare come around your town. If you called for help, nobody would hear you. You’ll have to fight. The leader looks like a difficult opponent, but if you took care of him the crew would likely scatter. The scrawniest member looks pretty easy to fight, but might enrage the other members.    </p>

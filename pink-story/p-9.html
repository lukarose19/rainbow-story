        Your Cupid is sad that you didn’t end up getting a date but something else seems to be bothering them. After pushing them a bit, they tell you that they’ve been trying to get you a partner for as long as you’ve been looking for one. Apparently your bad luck has been the result of them being frankly terrible at their job.         </p>

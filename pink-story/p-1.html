        You give in. In all honesty, as much as it stings to be called out by your friend, it is nice that they did this for you. You go to the Matchmaker. She’s a nice woman, if not a little strange. She invites you to have tea with her and you tell her your story. She says she has 3 candidates that might work for you.

        <h1>It’s almost unbelievable how many people have helped me throughout this whole process. </h1>
        <p> I’ve tried to include as much as I could in this and it will be updated until this game is finished and possibly even after that.</p>
        <p>An extra big thank you to my father, who this game would quite literally not exist without. My dad has taught me everything I know about coding and has spent hours sitting with me and puzzling out the somehow-working things I’ve made. This game would not run as smoothly as it does, be as organized as it is, look as pretty as it does, or even have the opportunity to exist at all without my dad guiding me through quite literally everything.
        </p>
        <p>To Kate, who has been my most enthusiastic play tester, who has given me more motivation to create this than I think they know. Love you bestie <3</p>
      <p>And to add on to that, thank you to every single one of my play testers. So many people have been beta testers for me that I can’t actually remember them all, so I’ll list out the ones off the top of my head(If I forgot you, I’m so sorry. I’m so grateful to you as well I just have the attention span of a two-year-old)</p>
      <p>My Mother, Luke, Caroline, Finley, Jillian, Eros, Quinn, Shawn, and Liam</p> 
      <p>Thank you all so much.</p>
      <p>Thank you to Shawn, not only for playtesting for me, letting me draw my silly little characters on his whiteboard, and being such a big support, but for actually coming up with the name of the entire game itself. The name “So Many Eyes” comes from when I first drew my cast of characters on his whiteboard and was lamenting the fact that I didn’t have a name for it yet. He wrote “So Many Eyes” above the whiteboard, as a joke I think, but it just kind of clicked into place.</p>
     <p>Thank you to Diane and Dalton for being amazing advisors for my community project and for helping me set up  for the final showcase of it.</p>
    <p>Thank you to Luke for sharing his love of coding and storycrafting with me. I cherish the times we spent rambling about anything and everything.</p>
    <p>Thank you to Finley for listening to me ramble about the various issues I’ve encountered, for playing through each storyline, for being a middle man for my various technology limitations, for seeing everything I’ve done, and for still liking me by the end of it. You’ve done more to help me than I think I could ever thank you for.</p> 
   <p>Thanks to you. For reading through this, and for playing through this game. In the end, I made this game for people to enjoy it.</p>

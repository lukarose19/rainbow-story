        As you are bolting back through the woods, you run into a well-dressed lad. He tells you that he is, in fact, the Prince. He managed to get down on his own and is now travelling back. You feel a little guilty for running away when it was your sworn duty to bring him back safe. He laughs it off and says he’ll pretend that you saved him from the dragon.
